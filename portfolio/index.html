            I am Ethan Hutton, I am currently an undergraduate student and Rose-Hulman. I am 19 years old and from Valparaiso Indiana. Growing up
            whenever I wasn't doing homework I leaned very heavily into video games as my hobby. I have a whole list that will probably never be completed
            in my lifetime, but I like it to remind me of games I might want ot play in the future. I did well in highschool academics. I got much more
            music and played hte guitar more seriously. I have not created anything in a while due to being at Rose, but hopefully in the future I will have
            the time to create more of what I would like.
        </p>

            I am currently trying to be a bit more involved on campus. I joined the Rover Robotics team and am an in class TA. My goal is to have an
            internship for the summer. There are also opportunities for minors that I need to look at. I have alot of space after coming in with quite
            a few credits, but I am still a bit aimless as to what I actually want to do. Hopefully this year at Rose will help me learn and explore
            the different options that I have.
