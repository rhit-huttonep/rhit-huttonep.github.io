        <h3>Projects:</h3>	
            <h4>Class Project: Editor Trees</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Created an AVL tree that must be kept height balanced at all times 
                    while allowing nodes to be inserted and deleted into the tree.
                </li>
                <li>Majority of the process included trial and error and debugging to 
                    figure out how the rules and restrictions were applied to tree to keep it balanced</li>
                <li>Used class containers, various toStrings, and our own unit tests in order to achieve success.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Class Project: Arcade game Project</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> a game similar to joust that involved collisions, inheritance, 
                    refactoring, and importing textures/sounds to make it functional
                </li>
                <li>Collisions involved creating a small intersection between each 
                    of the two collided objects and determining the lengths of x and y 
                    to see if it was a horizontal or vertical collision
                </li>
                <li>Similar looking blocks of code such as the hero and enemy were 
                    grouped into one larger game object to reduce redundant code
                </li>
            </ul>
